# 📦 Serverless Feedback Form – Mini Project

This project implements a serverless REST API using **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **DynamoDB** to collect and store user feedback. It was built as part of a cloud computing mini-project and deployed using **GitHub Actions** for automation.

## 📌 Overview

- Accepts feedback from users via POST request.
- Stores data (`name`, `email`, `message`) in DynamoDB.
- Powered by AWS services in a serverless architecture.
- Fully automated deployment through GitHub CI/CD.

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **Create IAM Role** with permissions for Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch.
2. **Deploy Lambda** with environment variables and link it to **API Gateway**.
3. Configure GitHub Actions with `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` secrets.

### Run CI/CD Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
on: [push]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup AWS CLI
      - run: |
          pip install awscli
          aws lambda update-function-code --function-name <your_lambda> --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```
